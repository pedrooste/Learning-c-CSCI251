Programming Defensively
While we are handling exceptions and conditions that we know could happen, we should also equip our code
to deal with errors that shouldnt occurr.

some examples include
-   throwing exceptions within a default switch case
-   using assertions to ensure that to determine data is within a specific range
-   creating independent program modules
-   validating all paremteres and return values
