/*
Friend Functions

Friend functions are funcitons that are functions that are defined outside
of the classes scope but still has access to all private and protected members.
This is done by passing the object reference to the method.

Even though these methods are defined within the class,
they are not member functions.

These can be defined by using the keyword (friend)
friend return_type function_name(Class & objClass){â€¦}
