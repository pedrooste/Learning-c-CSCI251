Data Mining
Exploring data through machine based technologies with the goal of discovering knowledge within the data

Machine learning
aims to equip computers with human like abilities, such as learning!

Predicitive tasks
    To make a prediction about the data, such as data classification, regression and time series analysis
    Classification
        Determines the attributes of data in order to place it into pre defined classifications. This is commonly
        seen within decision trees and neural networks.

        Other popular methods include linear classifiers and k-nearest neighbors (using other classified examples to classify yourself).

Descriptive tasks
    Describes the data characteristics, clustering, association rules, sequence discovery
    Clustering
        groups of similar data into clusters, such as determining what movies the user would like to watch.

Python vs C++?
    cpp is beneficial when wanting to control the hardware, they also have many libraries where machine learning has been implemented.
    Due to the compiler nature of cpp it is also faster than python
    However python has more community support and is easier to use as you dont need the level of depth in relation to dealing with hardware.

    Cpp is used within many applications that deal with systems at a hardware level, such as IOT and smart devices. It can also be used within in
    depth scenarios such as multi-thread and multi-process programming
